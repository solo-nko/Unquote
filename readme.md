# Unquote

## What is it?
It's a trivia quiz app made for Android. Unquote is the capstone project for Codecademy's Java for Android skill path, and I made it from scratch using assets they provided.

## Why did I make it?
Mainly to brush up on Java. I also thought it'd be really neat to make an Android app, which I've never done before. I learned a lot from the process.

## Tech Used
This app was written in Android Studio. It is built and debugged with Gradle. It is written entirely in Java and XML. It targets a minimum Android API of 26.

## Known Issues
The game summary screen doesn't load right now because of a fatal error that prevents it from retrieving the information it needs to function. I'm still learning how best to pass data between activities in Android, and actively looking into this.

## Things I'd like to do
- Add multiple quiz sets as modular "DLC"-style packages
- Brush up the look
